# AI Prompts Used for CI/CD Health Dashboard AWS Deployment

This document records the AI prompts and interactions used to create the Infrastructure-as-Code deployment for the CI/CD Health Dashboard.

## Project Overview Prompt

**Initial Request:**
```
Take your CI/CD Pipeline Health Dashboard (current repo code) and deploy it to the cloud using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).

Tasks:
1. Provision Infrastructure with IaC
   a. Use Terraform (preferred) to create:
      i. A VM/Compute instance (amazon EC2 free tier)
      ii. Networking basics (VPC + Security Group/Firewall)
      iii. A managed DB (if your app needs one, e.g., RDS/Postgres/CloudSQL)
2. Deploy Your App
   a. Use Terraform to install Docker + deploy your containerized app (from Assignment 2).
   b. App should be accessible via a public URL/IP.
3. AI-Native Workflow
   i. Generating Terraform code
   ii. Writing deployment scripts
   iii. Creating documentation

Expected Outcome:
• A live dashboard running on cloud (AWS)
• Infrastructure fully provisioned with Terraform (not manual clicks)
• Documentation showing how AI tools were used

Deliverables:
1. Terraform Scripts – committed to GitHub repo (/infra folder).
2. Deployment Guide (deployment.md)
   a. How to apply Terraform & deploy app
   b. AI prompts/examples used
3. Prompt Logs – record of prompts used (prompts.md).

need to use free tier AWS resources only where possible
```

## Analysis and Planning Prompts

```
I need to examine the current CI/CD Health Dashboard setup to understand:
1. The application architecture (frontend, backend, database)
2. Docker Compose configuration
3. Environment variables and dependencies
4. Port configurations
5. Database requirements

Please read and analyze the existing codebase structure.
```

**Repository URL Update Prompt:**

@https://github.com/rahulmudpalliwar/assignment2_cicd_health_dashboard.git 
i have not created a free tier aws account yet
```

## Infrastructure Design Prompts

**Terraform Architecture Prompt:**
```
Create Terraform scripts for AWS infrastructure that includes:

1. VPC with public subnet
2. Internet Gateway and Route Tables
3. Security Groups for:
   - SSH access (port 22)
   - Web traffic (ports 80, 443)
   - Application ports (3000 for API, 5173 for frontend)
   - Database access (port 5432, internal only)
4. EC2 instance (t2.micro free tier)
5. RDS PostgreSQL (db.t3.micro free tier)
6. Elastic IP for static public IP
7. All resources should be free tier eligible
```

**Security Configuration Prompt:**
```
Design security groups and networking for:
- Public web access to frontend and API
- SSH access for administration
- Internal database communication
- Following AWS security best practices
- Free tier resource constraints
```

## Deployment Script Prompts

**User Data Script Prompt:**
```
Create a user_data.sh script for EC2 instance initialization that:
1. Installs Docker and Docker Compose
2. Installs Git and Node.js
3. Clones the repository from GitHub
4. Sets up proper permissions
5. Creates environment file templates
6. Prepares the application directory structure
```

**Deployment Automation Prompt:**
```
Create a deployment script that:
1. Checks prerequisites (Terraform, AWS CLI, SSH)
2. Initializes and applies Terraform
3. Waits for EC2 instance to be ready
4. Updates environment variables with RDS endpoint
5. Starts the Docker containers
6. Verifies application is accessible
7. Provides helpful output and next steps
```

## Documentation Prompts

**AWS Setup Guide Prompt:**
```
Create a comprehensive AWS setup guide for beginners that includes:
1. Step-by-step AWS Free Tier account creation
2. AWS CLI installation and configuration
3. SSH key pair generation
4. Free tier limits and monitoring
5. Security best practices
6. Troubleshooting common issues
```

**Deployment Guide Prompt:**
```
Create a detailed deployment guide that includes:
1. Prerequisites and setup
2. Quick start instructions
3. Manual deployment steps
4. Infrastructure component descriptions
5. Application architecture overview
6. Monitoring and maintenance procedures
7. Cost management and cleanup
8. Troubleshooting guide
9. Security considerations
```

## Configuration Prompts

**Environment Variables Prompt:**
```
Update the deployment scripts to properly handle:
1. Database connection strings with RDS endpoint
2. Frontend API base URL configuration
3. Environment-specific settings
4. Secure password management
```

**Repository Integration Prompt:**
```
Update all scripts and configurations to use the correct repository URL:
https://github.com/rahulmudpalliwar/assignment2_cicd_health_dashboard.git

Ensure the deployment process correctly clones and deploys from this repository.
