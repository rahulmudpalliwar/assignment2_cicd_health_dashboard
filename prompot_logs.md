# Prompt Logs

This file contains example prompts used with AI tools (Cursor/Copilot/ChatGPT) during development.

Examples:

1. "Build a CI/CD pipeline health dashboard with Node.js backend, React frontend, Postgres DB, Docker Compose, and email alerts. Include polling of GitHub Actions and Jenkins, webhooks endpoints, and a simple metrics UI."
2. "Design a PostgreSQL schema for storing CI builds with fields: tool, external_id, repo, branch, status, started_at, completed_at, url, and logs."
3. "Implement Nodemailer email alert service that sends on newly detected failed builds, idempotent per external_id."

Add more logs here as you iterate.
